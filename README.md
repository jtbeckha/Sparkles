# Sparkles
Sparkles is a music visualizer for the terminal. It is an integral part of my master plan to get lots of karma on [/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/). It is still under active development.

## Usage
There are currently no CLI options.
```
cargo run
```

## Visualization Modes
Stereo dB Meter

Planned:
* Spectrum graph
* Some color options

If you have ideas for other visualizations feel free to open an issue! Be aware that some modularization/refactoring work still needs to be done to create a framework that makes it easy to add additional visualizations.

## Audio Backend Compatibility
Sparkles is currently compatible with PulseAudio
